## Overview

The Users API provides endpoints for managing user profiles and user-related data in the Trojan Marketplace application.

## User Context

User authentication is handled through the [Authentication API](/api/authentication). Once authenticated, user sessions are managed to maintain login state across the application.

### Session Management

When a user successfully logs in through the LoginServlet, the application maintains the authentication state. This is implemented in the Login component:

```javascript Login.js:89-91
if (response.data===true) {
  props.logIn();
  navigate("/feed");
}
```

The `logIn()` callback updates the application's authentication state, allowing users to access protected routes and features.

## User Data in Items

User information is associated with marketplace items. When items are created through the AddItemServlet, they are linked to the authenticated user's account.

### Item Ownership

Each item listing in the marketplace is associated with the user who created it. This relationship enables:

- Displaying seller information on item listings
- Enabling messaging between buyers and sellers
- Managing user's own listings

## User Interactions

The Users API supports various user interactions within the marketplace:

### Messaging

Users can message each other about items. This functionality is accessed through the Feed component:

```javascript Feed.js:30-33
function handleMessage(index) {
  modifyItem(items[index]);
  navigate("/message");
}
```

### Purchase Flow

Users can initiate purchases, which requires user authentication:

```javascript Feed.js:26-29
function handlePurchase(index) {
  modifyItem(items[index]);
  navigate("/purchase-item");
}
```

## Account Creation Flow

New users can create accounts through the CreateAccountServlet. The account creation process:

1. User submits email and password
2. Account is created in the system
3. User is redirected to login page
4. User can then authenticate and access marketplace features

See the [Authentication API](/api/authentication) for detailed endpoint specifications.
