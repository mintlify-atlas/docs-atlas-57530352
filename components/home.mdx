## Overview

The Home component serves as the landing page for the Trojan Marketplace application. It displays a welcome message, instructions for getting started, and information about meetup locations for completed transactions.

## Location

`src/Home.js`

## Props

This component does not accept any props.

## Features

### Welcome Message

Displays a centered welcome message introducing users to the Trojan Marketplace:

```jsx
<h2 style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>Welcome to the Trojan Marketplace</h2>
```

### Getting Started Instructions

Provides clear instructions for new users:

```jsx
<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  To get started, please click the login button to access the feed
</p>
```

### Meetup Location Information

Informs users about designated meetup locations for item exchanges:

```jsx
<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  Once items are sold, meet ups will be at RTCC, Entrance 4, and Leavey Library
</p>
```

### Campus Map Display

Features a prominent USC campus map image to help users identify locations:

```jsx
<div className="image">
  <img
    src="https://www.simpleimageresizer.com/_uploads/photos/f140f7ce/USC_map_pic_1_750x750.png"
    alt="large image"
  />
</div>
```

## Implementation Example

```javascript
import Home from './Home';
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  );
}
```

## Layout Structure

The component uses a container-based layout with two main sections:

1. **Image Section**: Displays the USC campus map
2. **Rectangles Section**: Contains the welcome text and instructions

```jsx
<div className="container">
  <div className="image">
    {/* Campus map */}
  </div>
  <div className="rectangles">
    <div className="rectangle">
      {/* Welcome content */}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Styling

The component relies on external CSS from `Home.css` for layout and styling. All text content uses inline `textAlign: 'center'` styling for center alignment.

## Designated Meetup Locations

The Home component specifies three official meetup locations for the Trojan Marketplace:

1. **RTCC** - Ronald Tutor Campus Center
2. **Entrance 4** - Campus entrance location
3. **Leavey Library** - Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Library

These locations are chosen for safety and convenience within the USC campus.

## User Flow

The Home component is typically the first page users see when visiting the application:

1. User arrives at the landing page
2. Reads welcome message and instructions
3. Views campus map for location reference
4. Clicks login button to access the marketplace feed
