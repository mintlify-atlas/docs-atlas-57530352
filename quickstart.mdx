</Note>

## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Repository">
    Clone the Trojan Marketplace repository to your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yangleyland/Trojan-Marketplace.git
    cd csci201-final-project
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    Install all required npm packages defined in `package.json:5-16`:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
    This will install:
    - **React 18.2.0** - Core UI library
    - **React Router DOM 6.10.0** - Client-side routing
    - **Axios 1.3.6** - HTTP client for API calls
    - **Styled Components 5.3.9** - CSS-in-JS styling
    - **React Scripts 5.0.1** - Build tooling from Create React App
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Development Server">
    Launch the application using the start script from `package.json:18`:
    
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    
    The development server will automatically:
    - Start on `http://localhost:3000`
    - Open in your default browser
    - Enable hot reload for live code changes
    - Display lint errors in the console
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access the Application">
    Once the server starts, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. You'll see the Trojan Marketplace home page as defined in `src/Home.js:4-22`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  **Success!** You should now see the Trojan Marketplace home page with the USC map and welcome message.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Port 3000 is already in use">

  <Accordion title="Backend connection errors">
    The application expects the backend at `http://localhost:8080/Final_Project/`. Ensure:
    - The Java servlet backend is running
    - The backend is accessible at the correct URL

    - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
    - Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then reinstall
    - Update npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`
    - Check your Node.js version meets requirements
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Styles not loading correctly">
    The application uses Styled Components (version 5.3.9). If styles aren't loading:
    - Ensure styled-components is properly installed
    - Check that CSS files are imported correctly
    - Clear browser cache and reload
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Development Workflow

Once you have the app running, here's a typical development workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Login">
    Click the "Login" link in the navbar to access the authentication page (route: `/login` defined in `src/Main.js:30`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an Account">
    If you don't have an account, click "Create Account" to register (route: `/create-account` defined in `src/Main.js:48`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access the Feed">
    After logging in, you'll be redirected to the marketplace feed (route: `/feed` defined in `src/Main.js:32-36`) where all items are displayed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Browse and Interact">
    From the feed, you can:
    - Click "Message" to contact sellers (navigates to `/message`)
    - Click "Buy Now" to purchase items (navigates to `/purchase-item`)
